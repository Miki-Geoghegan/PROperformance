            <h4>Training</h4>
            <p>Distance running entails road races and cross-country runs of varying distances including 10km, 15km, half marathon (21.1km) and the full marathon (42.2km). At the elite level, training usually involves two different training sessions a day adopting a hard-easy principle. For example, slow, longer runs or recovery/easy runs help build aerobic endurance. In contrast, intense continuous runs and interval/threshold sessions aim to improve anaerobic capacity and speed. Water running and weight training are included for injury rehabilitation.</p>
